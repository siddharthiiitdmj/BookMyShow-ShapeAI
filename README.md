# Book My Show Project
  -> This is a frontend clone of book my show website with some additional user friendly features.<br /> 
  -> The project is built using the react app and javascript with beautiful UI design and well maintained code.<br />
  -> I have used TMDB(3rd party API) to fetch details of movies and shows which is then displayed vividly on frontend using cards. <br />
  -> I have also included a dummy payment method using your mobile number with the help of Razorpay's API. <br />
  
 ### Overall its a completely frontend devoted project with some eye catching UI/UX design and good use of react-router-dom along with many other important features of react like hooks, HOC and layouts.
